This demonstrates a bug that occurs in inherited_resources when you name a model Resource.
To exercise the bug:

1) bundle install
2) rails s
3) in a separate window, do a POST:

curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -X POST -d ' {"resource": {"name": "Z087"}}' \
     http://localhost:3000/resources

4) in the rails log, you should see a "stack level too deep" error
